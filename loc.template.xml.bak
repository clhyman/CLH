<p>LETTERS FROM THE COUNTRY</p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>Phalanx, New Jersey, March 29, 1856.</p>
<p>About a week ago, in the course of a ramble along the wood&#8212;skirted banks of Trout Brook, we (wife and I) found a cluster of traling arbutus (Epigae repens) at the brink of a snow&#8212;drift, and particially covered by it, but with an abundance of flower&#8212;buds considerably developed. This plant, oftener than otherwise called May&#8212;flower, and sometimes ground laurel, is a singlular and interesting one. It grows in patches, and stretches vine&#8212;like over teh woodland hill&#8212;sides, hiding itself beneath dry leaves, as if too timid or too modest to meet the eye of any chance comer. How beautiful its clusters of pink and white blossoms are, and how delightfully fragrant! But one unacquainted with its habits might search through the spring&#8212;woods all day for it without being rewarded by a single flower, so concealed are its sweet treasures. It often blossoms here early in March, and sometimes even in February, but this year I think it will wait for the showers and sunshine of April. It is the earliest of our wild flowers, blossoming before the snow is fairly gone. Even the snow&#8212;drop is less hardy in this country, though in England it flowers in February, and M. de Condolle found it on the mountains of Switzerland with its little starry cups actually pushing themselves through the snow.</p>
                        <p>Nearly as early as the Epigens come the pretty little squirrel caps or liver&#8212;leaf(Hepatica), but I have seen no flower&38212;buds of the latter yet. These early spring flowers have a charm which later blossoms lack. The squirrel cups vary in color, some being white, others pink, and others still bluish or lilac&38212;colored</p>
